# CalPal
Your calorie counting buddy, CalPal

CalPal is a simple calorie tracking up for your day-to-day needs.

When you first access the app, you are greeted with the option to set your daily calorie goal. Upon entering your goal you're then presented with the dashboard and current stats of your day. 

You can add meals and the app will automatically update your remaining calories. You also have the ability to edit any meal entry or delete it altogether.
